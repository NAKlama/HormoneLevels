Compute and graph hormone levels for transgender HRT

## Current state of development

Since I'm developing this softwares features as I need them, it is currently only for
transfeminine HRT. It can graph the amount of estradiol valerate inside the body.

## Planned features

  - Calculate and plot blood level estimations from known levels at certain points
  - Graphing of long term fitting with known labs to detect shifts in metabolism
    - Ways to adjust for these
  - Different HRT options
    - Different Estradiol Esters
    - Testosterone Esters
    - Different methods of delivery

## Contributing

I'd love for some transmasculine folk to get in touch with me, and provide me with
the names and half-lifes of commonly used testosterone esters, so I can add them to
the project.

Of course, feel free to create the files for that yourself, and make a pull-request.
I'd be happy to collaborate with someone implementing some cool additional features.
